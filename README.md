CS 3410 Final Project

## Overview
This is a basic 2D topdown racing game. The player drives a car one lap around the track with the goal of minimizing their lap time. Driving off the track into the grass will slow down the car significantly, so players should try to steer carefully and accurately.


## Controls
Use the UP arrow key to accelerate.  
Use the RIGHT/LEFT arrow keys to turn right/left.
